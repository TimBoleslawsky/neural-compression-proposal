\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modern vehicles generate vast amounts of data from multi-modal sensors such as cameras, radar, LiDAR, and in-vehicle networks (IVNs) like CAN and LIN networks.
    \item Legacy IVNs such as Classical CAN (1 Mbit/s) and LIN (20 Kbit/s) were never designed for continuous high-bandwidth streams.
    \item To avoid overload, event-triggered or selective logging schemes are used.
    \item These reduce bandwidth but limit observability and introduce sampling bias, degrading downstream machine learning (ML) performance.
    \item The proliferation of ADAS and intelligent systems further multiplies data quantity and complexity.
    \item Hence, there is a pressing need for adaptive and ML-aware logging frameworks that preserve informational value while respecting resource constraints.
