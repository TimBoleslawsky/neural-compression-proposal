% Goals and challenges
To achieve this we define the following goals and challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Main goal:} Develop and evaluate a \emph{task-aware tokenization framework} for automotive data that balances computational efficiency, compression rate, and ML utility.
    \item \textbf{Sub-goals:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantify the loss in predictive utility when training ML models on uncompressed, tokenized and compressed data.
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenges:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agree on a downstream ML task or task type (e.g., predictive maintenance, anomaly detection).
        \item Define how computational efficiency will be measured (e.g., inference time, model size).
        \item Agree on a subset of the available automotive data. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
